Purpose:
The purpose of the program is to replace all occurrences of the find or prefix being passed in by the user.
If the find parameter is found it is replaced with all the replace parameters, if not then the program looks for the prefix.
If it is found the find parameter being passed in is prepended in front of the all the occurrences of the prefix found.
Moreover, if the neither are found then the program exits and nothing happens.

Usage:

make

./replace "find-parameter" "replace-parameter" "prefix-parameter"

make clean
